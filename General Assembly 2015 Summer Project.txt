General Assembly 2015 Summer Project

Sam Dreyfuss

I would like to build a model to predict the fall in stock prices.  After witnessing several crashes, I believe crashes may be predictable by looking at the following data points:

Stock price (over daily or weekly time period)
Sentiment from the investment community, such as stocktwits.com
Total retail holdings of equity holdings (as percentage) of outstanding equity
Generic valuation metric such as 12-month rolling Price-to-earnings ratio

I believe that a sudden rise in a stock that is trending positively via social media, has a high retail ownership percentage, and has a high valuation will likely fall.  I would like to determine if this is true and then create a model to monitor stocks for potentially profitable opportunities.

Prior to making the model, I feel as though this strategy will need to be “back tested” first, meaning I would like to determine if the data points are statistically significant in determining a collapse of stock price.  Once the model has been tested, I will proceed to building a model that collects data points from the internet and conducts the analysis on a day-to-day basis.

To obtain historical data points, I will begin by pulling a sample data set from Bloomberg.  I will pull prices, retail holdings, and valuations.  I will also attempt to derive sentiment.  

From this project, I hope to learn more about predictive analytics as well as sentiment analysis.
